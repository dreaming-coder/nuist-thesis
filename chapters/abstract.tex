本项目为非官方的南京信息工程大学硕博毕业大论文的模板，尽可能的做到不引入冗余的包和代码，考虑到有些同学对\LaTeX 更不熟悉，作者提供了详细的注释，并将该模板设为多文件的模式，初学者可以直接在分章节的文件中，填充文章内容，避免在单个文件中不会调整的尴尬。但是，必要的表格、图片和公式的排版知识仍是必须了解的，但是可以通过百度满足你的需求。

This project is an inofficial thesis template of Nanjing University of Information Science \& Technology. Due to the deficiency of the \LaTeX~knowledge, this template is integrated from several existing templates with some optimization of the  syntax. In addition, the template is set as multi files mode with a lot of comments for those who know little ablout \LaTeX. However, syntax about table, graph and formula is necessary to learn except that you pay someone to help you.
